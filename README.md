# Hi, I'm Atharv 👋

I'm an M.Sc. Data Science student at TU Braunschweig building **practical, real-world ML systems** that solve tough problems in medical devices, time-series forecasting, and industrial applications.

Most of my work is hands-on: optimized low-latency pipelines, reproducible code, and deployable models using Python, PyTorch, Azure ML, and signal processing tools. I focus on turning raw sensor data into reliable, high-performance solutions.

I share clean, well-documented projects and notebooks so you can clone → run → learn or extend right away.

## Technical Focus

• Ultra-low-latency real-time systems (<15ms signal processing for neonatal ventilators and medical devices)  

• Advanced time-series forecasting and anomaly detection (aviation delays, financial markets, apnea events)  

• Modern computer vision with YOLOv8 (traffic, robotics, and surveillance applications)  

• Scalable MLOps on Azure (automated pipelines, HyperDrive tuning, Docker, CI/CD)  

• Domain-driven AI solutions in healthcare, transportation, finance, and social media analytics  

• Open, reproducible projects with interactive dashboards (Streamlit, PyQtGraph) and notebooks

## About Me

• M.Sc. Data Science @ TU Braunschweig | B.E. Information Technology @ University of Mumbai

• Data Science & Azure ML Working Student @ Ingenieurbüro Dr.-Ing. Eugen Koch (real-time medical AI)

• IT Coordinator @ Institut für Philosophie, TU Braunschweig

• Core Skills: Python (pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow), Time-Series/Signal Processing, Azure ML, Docker, Tableau/Power BI

• Languages: English (C1), German (B1 in progress)

🌱 Currently seeking **internship or Master's thesis opportunities** in applied AI/ML, predictive analytics, medical/industrial data science, or MLOps – especially in Germany/Europe.
