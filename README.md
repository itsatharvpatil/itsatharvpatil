Hi, I'm Atharv 👋

I'm an M.Sc. Data Science student at TU Braunschweig, passionate about building **practical, real-world ML systems** — especially low-latency pipelines, time-series analysis, and signal processing in medical & industrial applications.

With 2+ years of hands-on experience as a working student, I focus on end-to-end solutions: from high-frequency sensor data processing to Azure MLOps deployments. I love turning complex data challenges into efficient, deployable models.

Most of my work is **code-first and reproducible**: clean notebooks, optimized pipelines, and dashboards you can run right away.

What I work on

* **Real-time Signal Processing**: <15ms latency respiratory detection for neonatal ventilators (SciPy, NumPy, PyQtGraph)
* **Time-Series & Predictive Modeling**: Forecasting delays, financial trends, and apnea events
* **Computer Vision**: YOLOv8-based traffic object detection for robotics/surveillance
* **MLOps & Cloud**: Azure ML pipelines, HyperDrive tuning, Docker, CI/CD
* **Domain Applications**: Medical devices, aviation delays, sentiment analysis on social data
* **Ready-to-run Projects**: Clone → install → explore (with Streamlit dashboards where possible)

Featured Projects

* **Real-Time Neonatal Ventilator Triggering System**  
  Engineered low-latency signal pipeline with adaptive filtering and fail-safe controls. Live diagnostic dashboard included.

* **Predictive Modeling for Airline Network Delays** (Ongoing)  
  ETL on massive BTS flight data + weather integration for pre-departure risk scoring.

* **Real-Time Traffic Object Detection with YOLOv8**  
  End-to-end detection of vehicles & pedestrians in video streams — deployable for autonomous systems.

* **AI Job Anxiety: Sentiment Analysis on Reddit**  
  Hybrid lexicon + context-aware model boosting accuracy ~25%; insights on tech layoffs.

* **Algorithmic Financial Forecasting**  
  Cloud-native Azure pipeline with tsfresh features, Random Forest, and walk-forward validation.

* **Online Certificate Generation & Verification System** (Published in IRJMETS 2022)  
  Secure C#/ASP.NET platform with AES-256 encryption.
