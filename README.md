# Hi, I'm Atharv 👋

I'm an M.Sc. Data Science student at TU Braunschweig building **practical, real-world ML systems** that solve tough problems in medical devices, time-series forecasting, and industrial applications.

Most of my work is hands-on: optimized low-latency pipelines, reproducible code, and deployable models using Python, PyTorch, Azure ML, and signal processing tools. I focus on turning raw sensor data into reliable, high-performance solutions.

I share clean, well-documented projects and notebooks so you can clone → run → learn or extend right away.

## What I work on

• Real-time signal processing & low-latency systems (<15ms respiratory detection for neonatal ventilators)
• Time-series analysis & predictive modeling (airline delays, financial trends, apnea events)
• Computer vision (YOLOv8 traffic object detection for robotics & surveillance)
• MLOps on Azure (pipelines, HyperDrive tuning, Docker, CI/CD)
• Applied AI domains: medical devices, aviation, finance, sentiment analysis
• Ready-to-run projects with Streamlit/PyQtGraph dashboards and notebooks

## About Me

• M.Sc. Data Science @ TU Braunschweig | B.E. Information Technology @ University of Mumbai

• Data Science & Azure ML Working Student @ Ingenieurbüro Dr.-Ing. Eugen Koch (real-time medical AI)

• IT Coordinator @ Institut für Philosophie, TU Braunschweig

• Core Skills: Python (pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow), Time-Series/Signal Processing, Azure ML, Docker, Tableau/Power BI

• Languages: English (C1), German (B1 in progress)

🌱 Currently seeking **internship or Master's thesis opportunities** in applied AI/ML, predictive analytics, medical/industrial data science, or MLOps – especially in Germany/Europe.
